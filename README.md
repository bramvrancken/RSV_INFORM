# RSV INFORM

Data and analysis files used for uncovering the global circulation dynamics of RSV and determining selective dynamics and key mutations that drive the genetic make-up of RSV populations. Results of this investigation are communicated in 'The Genomic Evolutionary Dynamics and Global Circulation Patterns of Respiratory Syncytial Virus' (under review). 

* Alignments in the folder 'Data set compilation' are those used for identyfying the well-supported RSV A and B clades containing all INFORM sequences (RSV.A.aln.wGB.noRC.knownDate.fasta for RSVA and RSV.B.aln.wGB.noRC.knownDate.fasta for RSVB). The final alignments used for phylogeographic reconstructions contain 1213 sequences for RSVA and 1223 sequences for RSVB.

* The folder 'GLM' groups files used for the GLM analyses. Likewise, the folders 'RC' and 'Entropy measures' group files used for respectively the robust counting analyses and the summary of the extent of geographic mixing measured as a normalised entropy. 

* Fig.S1.RSV.A.AA.changes.pdf and Fig.S2.RSV.B.AA.changes.pdf summarize results of the site-specific selection analyses. 

* RSV.A.sampling.info.txt and RSV.B.sampling.info.txt detail the number of newly generated near full genomes by sampling site. For each site, the minimum, maximum and median length of the near full genomes is also given.
