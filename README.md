# RSV_INFORM

Data and analysis files used for uncovering the global circulation dynamics of RSV and determining the selective dynamics and key mutations that drive the genetic make-up of RSV populations. Results of this investigation are communicated in 'The Genomic Evolutionary Dynamics and Global Circulation Patterns of Respiratory Syncytial Virus' (pending review).
